Log on to Hostinger website with the google login of Local Loop (project.localloop@gmail.com).

You'd be able to see a hosting purchase and a domain name purchase. All you need to do is setup the hosting via migrating the website. Just create the zip file and upload it onto the website. Try tinkering with the website. Once all the features are accessible, just let me know, we'll start promoting our first step towards our success.

Also, try using these add ons for the website. The pngs used looks a bit off as per the design of the website. You can download any image or a frame from figma by selecting that frame and on the right hand bottom side, you'll see an export button.
